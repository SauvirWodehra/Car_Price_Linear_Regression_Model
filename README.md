## ⚙️ Features Explained  

Some important features from the dataset:  

- 🏎️ **Model** → Different car models (e.g., Fiesta, Focus, Mondeo). Popular or premium models usually have higher prices.  
- 📅 **Year** → Newer cars retain more value, while older ones depreciate.  
- ⚙️ **Transmission** → Gearbox type (Manual, Automatic, Semi-Auto). Automatic cars are often more expensive.  
- 📏 **Mileage** → Total kilometers driven. More mileage → lower price due to wear and tear.  
- ⛽ **Fuel Type** → Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, Electric. Fuel demand and efficiency affect pricing.  
- 💰 **Tax** → Road tax; higher tax can make a car less desirable.  
- ⛽ **MPG** → Miles per gallon, a measure of fuel efficiency. Higher MPG cars are cost-efficient and attractive to buyers.  
- 🔧 **Engine Size** → Bigger engines usually mean more power, but also more cost.
